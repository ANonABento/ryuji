# Discord Setup

How to create a Discord bot and connect it to Choomfie.

## 1. Create a Discord Application

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application**
3. Name it "Choomfie" (or whatever you want)
4. Go to **Bot** tab in the sidebar

## 2. Configure the Bot

1. Click **Reset Token** to generate a bot token
2. Copy the token — you'll need it next
3. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - **Message Content Intent** (required)

## 3. Generate an Invite Link

1. Go to **OAuth2 > URL Generator** in the sidebar
2. Select scopes: `bot`
3. Select permissions:
   - View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Send Messages in Threads
   - Read Message History
   - Attach Files
   - Add Reactions
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser
5. Select your server and authorize

## 4. Configure Choomfie

In Claude Code:
```bash
/choomfie:configure <your_bot_token>
```

This saves the token to the plugin data directory (`.env` file).

## 5. Start Choomfie

```bash
choomfie
```

Or manually:
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/choomfie --dangerously-load-development-channels server:choomfie
```

You should see in stderr:
```
Choomfie Discord: logged in as Choomfie#1234
```

## 6. Owner & Access

The bot **auto-detects the owner** — whoever created the bot in the Discord developer portal is automatically set as the owner. This happens during `./install.sh` or as a startup fallback. No manual configuration needed.

The owner gets:
- Full access to all tools (Bash, file ops, etc.)
- Permission relay — tool approval requests sent via DM
- Ability to approve/deny with `yes <code>` or `no <code>`

To add other users:
1. They DM the bot `!pair` on Discord
2. They get a 5-letter pairing code
3. In Claude Code: `/choomfie:access pair <code>`
4. Lock down: `/choomfie:access policy allowlist`

Other users get chat, memory, and reminder access only (no system tools).

## 7. Test

In your Discord server (`@mention` required in servers):
```
@Choomfie hey, what's up?
@Choomfie remember my name is Ben
@Choomfie what do you know about me?
```

In DMs (no mention needed):
```
hey, what's up?
what's your status?
```

## Modes

```bash
choomfie            # interactive — you + Discord, Claude Code terminal
choomfie --tmux     # background — same as above, survives terminal close
choomfie --daemon   # autonomous — Discord-only, Claude sessions auto-cycle
```

**Daemon mode** runs the meta-supervisor (`meta.ts`) which uses the Agent SDK to spawn Claude Code sessions programmatically. When context gets heavy (~120k tokens or 80 turns), it captures a handoff summary and cycles to a fresh session automatically. No human in the loop — Discord is the only interface.

Combine flags for always-on daemon: `choomfie --daemon --tmux` or `choomfie --daemon --always-on` (also prevents macOS sleep).

For manual interactive setup:
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/choomfie --dangerously-load-development-channels server:choomfie
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Bot doesn't respond | Check Message Content Intent is enabled |
| "No DISCORD_TOKEN" | Run `/choomfie:configure <token>` |
| Not receiving messages | Check allowlist with `/choomfie:access list` |
| Permission prompts block | Reply to the DM with `yes <code>` or `no <code>` |
| Bot is slow | Normal — Claude Code processes sequentially |
