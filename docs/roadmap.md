- [ ] Webhook endpoint — external services push notifications through bot

## Phase 13: More Channels

- [ ] Telegram channel (separate plugin or unified server)
- [ ] Slack channel
- [ ] Webhook channel (generic HTTP inbound)
- [ ] Web UI channel

## Phase 14: Daemon Mode (Done)

> See [architecture-v2.md](architecture-v2.md) for full design

- [x] `daemon.ts` — Agent SDK entry point for autonomous operation
- [x] Session cycling — auto-cycle Claude sessions at ~120K tokens or 80 turns
- [x] Handoff summaries — capture and inject context across session cycles
- [x] Worker health monitoring — PID-based health checks, auto-recovery

## Phase 16: Simulation (Dead Internet Theory)

- [ ] choomfie-sim — individual persona bots that simulate real people
  - [ ] Each clone is a separate Discord bot with its own Choomfie instance
  - [ ] Persona prompts scraped/reverse-engineered from real chat history
  - [ ] Per-clone memory context (key facts, relationships, opinions from their real messages)
  - [ ] Bot-to-bot interaction — clones react to each other's messages, not just the user
  - [ ] Conversation triggering — clones initiate topics based on time of day, shared interests

  - [ ] Vocabulary frequency analysis
  - [ ] Typo pattern detection
  - [ ] Response timing/length profiling
  - [ ] Topic/interest extraction
- [ ] Simulation modes
  - [ ] Passive — clones chat among themselves, user observes
  - [ ] Active — user participates alongside clones
  - [ ] Scenario — seed a topic and watch clones react

## Smart Memory (Ongoing)

- [ ] Cross-session recall — auto-search archival when context seems relevant
- [ ] Vector embeddings for semantic archival search
- [ ] Memory decay — auto-archive stale core memories

## Testing & CI

> See [testing.md](testing.md) for full strategy

- [ ] E2E tests — spawn server, verify startup/shutdown/PID lifecycle
- [ ] E2E tests — MCP tool round-trips over stdio
- [ ] E2E tests — Discord message flow (test bot + test server)
- [ ] Unit tests — reminders, memory, conversation, time, config
- [ ] Plugin tests — voice, tutor, socials, browser
- [ ] CI pipeline — run tests + type-check + lint on PRs
- [ ] Merge gates — block PR on test/lint failure

## Non-Goals (For Now)

- **Multi-user isolation** — Choomfie is a personal assistant
- **Custom model training** — use Claude as-is
