# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — Monorepo (2026-04-02)

### Breaking Changes

- Restructured from flat layout to Bun monorepo with workspace packages
- Old `plugins/` directory removed — plugins are now workspace packages under `packages/`
- Old `lib/`, `server.ts`, `supervisor.ts`, `worker.ts` moved into `packages/core/`
- Old `skills/` moved to `packages/core/skills/`

### Added

- `@choomfie/shared` — shared types, utilities, time helpers, path resolution
- `@choomfie/core` — MCP server, Discord bridge, memory, reminders, tools
- `@choomfie/voice` — voice plugin (STT/TTS/VAD)
- `@choomfie/browser` — browser plugin (Playwright)
- `@choomfie/tutor` — tutor plugin (FSRS, lessons, Japanese module)
- `@choomfie/socials` — socials plugin (YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn)
- `PluginContext` type in shared package — minimal context subset for plugins
- `findMonorepoRoot()` — resilient project root resolution
- Explicit workspace package map in plugin loader

### Changed

- Plugins import from `@choomfie/shared` instead of relative `../../lib/` paths
- Plugin interface (`Plugin`, `ToolDef`, `text()`, `err()`) defined in shared package
- Time utilities (`parseNaturalTime`, `formatDuration`, etc.) moved to shared package
- Interaction registries moved to shared package (dispatch stays in core)
- `VERSION` constant reads from root `package.json`
- Entry point is `packages/core/server.ts` (via `bun run start`)
- All docs updated with new `packages/` paths

### Removed

- `plugins/` directory (replaced by `packages/`)
- Duplicate type definitions across packages
- Dead `findMonorepoRoot` argument in boot test
